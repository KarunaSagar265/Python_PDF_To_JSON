Scientists believe that the first forms of life on Earth were microorganisms that existed for billions\nof years in the ocean before plants and animals appeared. The mammals, birds, and flowers so familiar\nto us are all relatively recent, originating 130 to 250 million years ago. The earliest representatives of the\ngenus Homo, to which we belong, have inhabited this planet for only the last 2.5 million years, and only\nin the last 300,000 years have humans started looking like we do today.\nChapter Outline\n1.1 The Science of\nBiology\n1.2 Themes and\nConcepts of Biology\n",

This is a very broad definition because the\nscope of biology is vast. Biologists may study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic view of a cell\nto ecosystems and the whole living planet (Figure 1.2). Listening to the daily news, you will quickly realize\nhow many aspects of biology we discuss every day. For example, recent news topics include Escherichia coli\n(Figure 1.3) outbreaks in spinach and Salmonella contamination in peanut butter. Other subjects include\nefforts toward finding a cure for AIDS, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and cancer. On a global scale, many researchers\nare committed to finding ways to protect the planet, solve environmental issues, and reduce the effects of\nclimate change. All of these diverse endeavors are related to different facets of the discipline of biology.\nFigure 1.3 Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, in this scanning electron micrograph, are normal residents of our\ndigestive tracts that aid in absorbing vitamin K and other nutrients. However, virulent strains are sometimes\nresponsible for disease outbreaks. (credit: Eric Erbe, digital colorization by Christopher Pooley, both of USDA, ARS,\nEMU)\nThe Process of Science\nBiology is a science, but what exactly is science? What does the study of biology share with other scientific\ndisciplines? We can define science (from the Latin scientia, meaning \u201cknowledge\u201d) as knowledge that covers\ngeneral truths or the operation of general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific\nmethod. It becomes clear from this definition that applying scientific method plays a major role in science.\nThe scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful\nobservation.\n8\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n",

            "text": "We will examine scientific method steps in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of\nhypotheses by means of repeatable experiments. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which one can test.\nAlthough using the scientific method is inherent to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is. This is because it is\nrelatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as physics and chemistry, but when it comes to disciplines like\narchaeology, psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as repeating experiments becomes more\ndifficult.\nThese areas of study are still sciences, however. Consider archaeology\u2014even though one cannot perform repeatable\nexperiments, hypotheses may still be supported. For instance, an archaeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture existed\nbased on finding a piece of pottery. He or she could make further hypotheses about various characteristics of this culture, which\ncould be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from other findings. A hypothesis may become a verified\ntheory. A theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena. Therefore, we may be better off to define\nscience as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe.\nNatural Sciences\nWhat would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about how the brain\nfunctions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Maybe all of the above? Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy,\nbiology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (Figure 1.4). However, scientists consider those\nfields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes natural sciences. Thus, a museum of natural\nsciences might contain any of the items listed above.\nFigure 1.4 The diversity of scientific fields includes astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, mathematics,\nand many other fields. (credit: \u201cImage Editor\u201d/Flickr)\nThere is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include, however. For some experts, the\nnatural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences\ninto life sciences, which study living things and include biology, and physical sciences, which study nonliving matter and\ninclude astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life\nand physical sciences and are interdisciplinary.

            "text": "quantitative data. Social sciences that study society and human behavior are more likely to use qualitative assessments to drive\ninvestigations and findings.\nNot surprisingly, the natural science of biology has many branches or subdisciplines. Cell biologists study cell structure and\nfunction, while biologists who study anatomy investigate the structure of an entire organism. Those biologists studying\nphysiology, however, focus on the internal functioning of an organism. Some areas of biology focus on only particular types of\nliving things. For example, botanists explore plants, while zoologists specialize in animals.\nScientific Reasoning\nOne thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal \u201cto know.\u201d Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for the\ndevelopment of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. To do this, they use two methods of\nlogical thinking: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.\nInductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion. This type of\nreasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and records them. These data\ncan be qualitative or quantitative, and one can supplement the raw data with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many\nobservations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating\ngeneralizations inferred from careful observation and analyzing a large amount of data. Brain studies provide an example. In\nthis type of research, scientists observe many live brains while people are engaged in a specific activity, such as viewing images\nof food. The scientist then predicts the part of the brain that \u201clights up\u201d during this activity to be the part controlling the\nresponse to the selected stimulus, in this case, images of food. Excess absorption of radioactive sugar derivatives by active areas\nof the brain causes the various areas to \"light up\". Scientists use a scanner to observe the resultant increase in radioactivity.\nThen, researchers can stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar responses result.\nDeductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reason, the pattern of\nthinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking\nthat uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and\npredict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. Studies in climate change can illustrate\nthis type of reasoning. For example, scientists may predict that if the climate becomes warmer in a particular region, then the\ndistribution of plants and animals should change.\nBoth types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesis-based\nscience. Descriptive (or discovery) science, which is usually inductive, aims to observe, explore, and discover, while hypothesis-\nbased science, which is usually deductive, begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that one\ncan test. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors combine both\napproaches. The fuzzy boundary becomes apparent when thinking about how easily observation can lead to specific questions.\nFor example, a gentleman in the 1940s observed that the burr seeds that stuck to his clothes and his dog\u2019s fur had a tiny hook\nstructure. On closer inspection, he discovered that the burrs\u2019 gripping device was more reliable than a zipper. He eventually\nexperimented to find the best material that acted similar, and produced the hook-and-loop fastener popularly known today as\nVelcro. Descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.\nThe Scientific Method\nBiologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses. Known as scientific method,\nthis approach is common to other sciences as well. The scientific method was used even in ancient times, but England\u2019s Sir\nFrancis Bacon (1561\u20131626) first documented it (Figure 1.5). He set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific\nmethod is not used only by biologists; researchers from almost all fields of study can apply it as a logical, rational problem-\nsolving method.\n10\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n",

            "text": "Figure 1.5 Historians credit Sir Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) as the first to define the scientific method. (credit: Paul van Somer)\nThe scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to solve) that leads to a question. Let\u2019s think about a\nsimple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem. One Monday morning, a\nstudent arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes a\nproblem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: \u201cWhy is the classroom so warm?\u201d\nProposing a Hypothesis\nRecall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that one can test. To solve a problem, one can propose several hypotheses. For\nexample, one hypothesis might be, \u201cThe classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.\u201d However, there\ncould be other responses to the question, and therefore one may propose other hypotheses. A second hypothesis might be, \u201cThe\nclassroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nOnce one has selected a hypothesis, the student can make a prediction. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has\nthe format \u201cIf . . . then . . . .\u201d For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, \u201cIf the student turns on the air\nconditioning, then the classroom will no longer be too warm.\u201d\nTesting a Hypothesis\nA valid hypothesis must be testable. It should also be falsifiable, meaning that experimental results can disprove it. Importantly,\nscience does not claim to \u201cprove\u201d anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further\ninformation. This step\u2014openness to disproving ideas\u2014is what distinguishes sciences from non-sciences. The presence of the\nsupernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable. To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more\nexperiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or\nmore controls. A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. The control group\ncontains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that the researcher hypothesizes.\nTherefore, if the experimental group's results differ from the control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized\nmanipulation, rather than some outside factor. Look for the variables and controls in the examples that follow. To test the first\nhypothesis, the student would find out if the air conditioning is on. If the air conditioning is turned on but does not work, there\nshould be another reason, and the student should reject this hypothesis. To test the second hypothesis, the student could check\nif the lights in the classroom are functional. If so, there is no power failure and the student should reject this hypothesis. The\nstudents should test each hypothesis by carrying out appropriate experiments. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not\ndetermine whether or not one can accept the other hypotheses. It simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid (Figure 1.6).\nUsing the scientific method, the student rejects the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data.\nWhile this \u201cwarm classroom\u201d example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments might have clearer\ncontrols. For instance, a student might attend class on Monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating on the lecture. One\n1.1 \u2022 The Science of Biology\n11\n",

We call this type of reasoning\ndeductive reasoning: deduction proceeds from the general to the particular. However, the reverse of the process is also possible:\nsometimes, scientists reach a general conclusion from a number of specific observations. We call this type of reasoning\ninductive reasoning, and it proceeds from the particular to the general.

            "text": "experiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion.\nInstead, scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds. Scientific\nreasoning is more complex than the scientific method alone suggests. Notice, too, that we can apply the scientific method to\nsolving problems that aren\u2019t necessarily scientific in nature.\nTwo Types of Science: Basic Science and Applied Science\nThe scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the value of different types of science. Is it valuable to\npursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth if we can apply it to\nsolving a specific problem or to bettering our lives? This question focuses on the differences between two types of science: basic\nscience and applied science.\nBasic science or \u201cpure\u201d science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that knowledge. It is not\nfocused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The immediate goal of basic science is\nknowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake, although this does not mean that, in the end, it may not result in a practical application.\nIn contrast, applied science or \u201ctechnology,\u201d aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible, for example, to\nimprove a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster (Figure 1.8). In applied\nscience, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.\nFigure 1.8 After Hurricane Irma struck the Caribbean and Florida in 2017, thousands of baby squirrels like this one were thrown from their\nnests. Thanks to applied science, scientists knew how to rehabilitate the squirrel. (credit: audreyjm529, Flickr)\nSome individuals may perceive applied science as \u201cuseful\u201d and basic science as \u201cuseless.\u201d A question these people might pose to a\nscientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, \u201cWhat for?\u201d However, a careful look at the history of science reveals that\nbasic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many scientists think that a basic understanding\nof science is necessary before researchers develop an application therefore, applied science relies on the results that researchers\ngenerate through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science in order to find solutions to\nactual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that demand immediate attention; however,\nscientists would find few solutions without the help of the wide knowledge foundation that basic science generates.\nOne example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of DNA\nstructure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication. DNA strands, unique in every\nhuman, are in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. When DNA replicates, it produces new copies of\nitself, shortly before a cell divides. Understanding DNA replication mechanisms enabled scientists to develop laboratory\ntechniques that researchers now use to identify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine\npaternity. Without basic science, it is unlikely that applied science would exist.\nAnother example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which researchers\nanalyzed and mapped each human chromosome to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and each gene's exact\nlocation. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity represented by a specific DNA segment that codes for a functional molecule. An\n14\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n",

Researchers have studied other less complex organisms as part of\nthis project in order to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (Figure 1.9) relied on\nbasic research with simple organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the\ndata for applied research, seeking cures and early diagnoses for genetically related diseases.\nFigure 1.9 The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several different science fields.\nResearchers completed the project, which sequenced the entire human genome, in 2003. (credit: the U.S. Department of Energy Genome\nPrograms (http://genomics.energy.gov (http://openstax.org/l/genomics_gov) )\nWhile scientists usually carefully plan research efforts in both basic science and applied science, note that some discoveries are\nmade by serendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming\ndiscovered penicillin when he accidentally left a petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria open. An unwanted mold grew on the dish,\nkilling the bacteria. Fleming's curiosity to investigate the reason behind the bacterial death, followed by his experiments, led to\nthe discovery of the antibiotic penicillin, which is produced by the fungus Penicillium. Even in the highly organized world of\nscience, luck\u2014when combined with an observant, curious mind\u2014can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.\nReporting Scientific Work\nWhether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other researchers\nto expand and build upon their discoveries. Collaboration with other scientists\u2014when planning, conducting, and analyzing\nresults\u2014are all important for scientific research. For this reason, important aspects of a scientist\u2019s work are communicating\nwith peers and disseminating results to peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or\nconference, but this approach can reach only the select few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in\npeer-reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals. Peer-reviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that a\nscientist\u2019s colleagues or peers review. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who\njudge whether or not the scientist\u2019s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research\nin a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for\nresearch funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their\nexperiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must be consistent with\nthe findings of other scientists.\nA scientific paper is very different from creative writing. Although creativity is required to design experiments, there are fixed\nguidelines when it comes to presenting scientific results. First, scientific writing must be brief, concise, and accurate. A\nscientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments.\nThe scientific paper consists of several specific sections\u2014introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. This\nstructure is sometimes called the \u201cIMRaD\u201d format. There are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an\nabstract (a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper. There might be additional sections depending on the type of paper\n1.1 \u2022 The Science of Biology\n15\n",

The description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to\nrepeat the experiment and obtain similar results, but it does not have to be verbose. This section will also include information on\nhow the researchers made measurements and the types of calculations and statistical analyses they used to examine raw data.\nAlthough the materials and methods section gives an accurate description of the experiments, it does not discuss them.\nSome journals require a results section followed by a discussion section, but it is more common to combine both. If the journal\ndoes not allow combining both sections, the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation. The\nresearchers present results with tables or graphs, but they do not present duplicate information. In the discussion section, the\nresearchers will interpret the results, describe how variables may be related, and attempt to explain the observations. It is\nindispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific\nresearch. Therefore, researchers include proper citations in this section as well.\nFinally, the conclusion section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings. While the scientific paper almost\ncertainly answers one or more scientific questions that the researchers stated, any good research should lead to more questions.\nTherefore, a well-done scientific paper allows the researchers and others to continue and expand on the findings.\nReview articles do not follow the IMRAD format because they do not present original scientific findings, or primary literature.\nInstead, they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature and typically include extensive\nreference sections.\n1.2 Themes and Concepts of Biology\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\n\u2022\nIdentify and describe the properties of life\n\u2022\nDescribe the levels of organization among living things\n\u2022\nRecognize and interpret a phylogenetic tree\n\u2022\nList examples of different subdisciplines in biology\nBiology is the science that studies life, but what exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious response, but\nit is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the\ncharacteristics of living entities but lack others. Although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even\nreproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. Consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly\nspeaking. Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life. Since the events that preceded life\nare not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term.\nFrom its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are the shared properties that make something\n\u201calive\u201d? Once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? Finally, when faced\nwith the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand\nthem? As scientists discover new organisms every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.\nProperties of Life\nAll living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment,\nreproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution. When viewed\ntogether, these eight characteristics serve to define life.\n16\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n",

(credit:\n\u201cIvengo\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)\nOrganisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled\norganisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms comprise molecules. These in turn comprise cell organelles and other\ncellular inclusions. In multicellular organisms (Figure 1.10), similar cells form tissues. Tissues, in turn, collaborate to create\norgans (body structures with a distinct function). Organs work together to form organ systems.\nSensitivity or Response to Stimuli\nFigure 1.11 The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched. After a few minutes, the plant\nreturns to normal. (credit: Alex Lomas)\nOrganisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or\nrespond to touch (Figure 1.11). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called chemotaxis) or light\n(phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus is a negative response.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/movement_plants) to see how plants respond to a stimulus\u2014from opening to light, to\nwrapping a tendril around a branch, to capturing prey.\nReproduction\nSingle-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide to\nform two new cells. Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline, gamete, oocyte, and sperm cells.\nAfter fertilization (the fusion of an oocyte and a sperm cell), a new individual develops.

These genes ensure that the offspring will belong to the same\nspecies and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape.\nAdaptation\nAll living organisms exhibit a \u201cfit\u201d to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as adaptation, and it is a consequence of\nevolution by natural selection, which operates in every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples of adaptations are diverse\nand unique, from heat-resistant Archaea that live in boiling hotsprings to the tongue length of a nectar-feeding moth that\nmatches the size of the flower from which it feeds. All adaptations enhance the reproductive potential of the individuals\nexhibiting them, including their ability to survive to reproduce. Adaptations are not constant. As an environment changes,\nnatural selection causes the characteristics of the individuals in a population to track those changes.\nGrowth and Development\nOrganisms grow and develop as a result of genes providing specific instructions that will direct cellular growth and\ndevelopment. This ensures that a species\u2019 young (Figure 1.12) will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its\nparents.\nFigure 1.12 Although no two look alike, these kittens have inherited genes from both parents and share many of the same characteristics.\n(credit: Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue)\nRegulation/Homeostasis\nEven the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions,\nrespond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses.

For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through the thermoregulation process.\nOrganisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 1.13), have body structures that help them withstand low\ntemperatures and conserve body heat. Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur, feathers, blubber, and fat. In hot\nclimates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.\nEnergy Processing\nFigure 1.14 The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) uses chemical energy derived from food to power flight. California condors\nare an endangered species. This bird has a wing tag that helps biologists identify the individual. (credit: Pacific Southwest Region U.S. Fish\nand Wildlife Service)\nAll organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities. Some organisms capture energy from the sun and convert it\ninto chemical energy in food. Others use chemical energy in molecules they take in as food (Figure 1.14).\nEvolution\nThe diversity of life on Earth is a result of mutations, or random changes in hereditary material over time. These mutations allow\nthe possibility for organisms to adapt to a changing environment. An organism that evolves characteristics fit for the\nenvironment will have greater reproductive success, subject to the forces of natural selection.\nLevels of Organization of Living Things\nLiving things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that we can examine on a scale from small to large. The\natom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form\nmolecules. A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds.\nMany molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules, large molecules that are typically formed by\npolymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than\nmacromolecules). An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Figure 1.15), which contains the instructions\nfor the structure and functioning of all living organisms.\n1.2 \u2022 Themes and Concepts of Biology\n19\n",

We call these organelles. Organelles are small\nstructures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable\nfunctions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in\nsunlight to make sugars. All living things are made of cells. The cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and\nfunction in living organisms. (This requirement is why scientists do not consider viruses living: they are not made of cells. To\nmake new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell. Only then can they obtain the\nmaterials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Scientists classify cells as\nprokaryotic or eukaryotic. Prokaryotes are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-bound nuclei. In\ncontrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus.\nIn larger organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions.\nOrgans are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function. Organs are present not only in animals but\nalso in plants. An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. Mammals have\nmany organ systems. For instance, the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs. It\nincludes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. Organisms are individual living entities.

It is a diagram showing the\nevolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both.\nNodes and branches comprise a phylogenetic tree. The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when,\nbased on scientific evidence, researchers believe an ancestor has diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch is\nproportional to the time elapsed since the split.\nFigure 1.17 Microbiologist Carl Woese constructed this phylogenetic tree using data that he obtained from sequencing ribosomal RNA\ngenes. The tree shows the separation of living organisms into three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Bacteria and Archaea are\nprokaryotes, single-celled organisms lacking intracellular organelles. (credit: Eric Gaba; NASA Astrobiology Institute)\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\nCarl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree\nIn the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. They based\nthe organizational scheme mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of\nwhich modern systematics use. American microbiologist Carl Woese's pioneering work in the early 1970s has shown, however,\nthat life on Earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domains\u2014Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The first two are\nprokaryotic cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the eukaryotes\nand includes unicellular microorganisms (protists), together with the three remaining kingdoms (fungi, plants, and animals).\nWoese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (Figure 1.17). Many organisms belonging to\nthe Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic\nrelationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape).\nWoese constructed his tree from universally distributed comparative gene sequencing that are present in every organism, and\nconserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution). Woese\u2019s approach was\nrevolutionary because comparing physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly\nsimilar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability (Figure 1.18). Comparing homologous DNA and\nRNA sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified\nseparating the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.\n22\nChapter 1 \u2022 The Study of Life\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n",

Biologists may pursue one of those\nsubdisciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance, molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at\nthe molecular and chemical level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the way\nthey are regulated. Microbiology, the study of microorganisms, is the study of the structure and function of single-celled\norganisms. It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists,\necologists, and geneticists, among others.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nForensic Scientist\nForensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law. Biologists as well as chemists and\nbiochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves\nexamining trace materials associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly\nbecause of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, developing molecular techniques and\nestablishing DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily\nrelated to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood,\nand other body fluids and also processing DNA (Figure 1.19) found in many different environments and materials. Forensic\nscientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. Students who want to\npursue careers in forensic science will most likely have to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math\ncourses.\n1.2 \u2022 Themes and Concepts of Biology\n23\n",

Science\nhas many fields. Those fields related to the physical world\nand its phenomena are natural sciences.\nScience can be basic or applied. The main goal of basic\nscience is to expand knowledge without any expectation of\nshort-term practical application of that knowledge. The\nprimary goal of applied research, however, is to solve\npractical problems.\nScience uses two types of logical reasoning. Inductive\nreasoning uses particular results to produce general\nscientific principles. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical\nthinking that predicts results by applying general principles.\nThe common thread throughout scientific research is using\nthe scientific method, a step-based process that consists of\nmaking observations, defining a problem, posing\nhypotheses, testing these hypotheses, and drawing one or\nmore conclusions. The testing uses proper controls.\nScientists present their results in peer-reviewed scientific\npapers published in scientific journals. A scientific research\npaper consists of several well-defined sections: introduction,\nmaterials and methods, results, and, finally, a concluding\ndiscussion. Review papers summarize the conducted\nresearch in a particular field over a period of time.\n1.2 Themes and Concepts of\nBiology\nBiology is the science of life. All living organisms share\nseveral key properties such as order, sensitivity or response\nto stimuli, reproduction, growth and development,\nregulation, homeostasis, and energy processing. Living\nthings are highly organized parts of a hierarchy that includes\natoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and\norgan systems. In turn, biologists group organisms as\npopulations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere.\nThe great diversity of life today evolved from less-diverse\nancestral organisms over billions of years. We can use a\nphylogenetic tree to show evolutionary relationships among\norganisms.\nBiology is very broad and includes many branches and\nsubdisciplines. Examples include molecular biology,\nmicrobiology, neurobiology, zoology, and botany, among\nothers.\n26\nChapter 1 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org.\n",
